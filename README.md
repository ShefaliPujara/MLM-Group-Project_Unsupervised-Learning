3. Project Objectives & Problem Statements
Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering

Project Objectives:

Segmentation of the imports-exports dataset using unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithms (K-Means).
Identification of the optimal number of clusters for the dataset based on evaluation metrics (Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Score).
Characterization of the identified clusters based on the distribution of variables like Quantity, Value, Weight, Import_Export, Category, Shipping_Method, and Payment_Terms.
Problem Statements:

How can the imports-exports dataset be effectively segmented into meaningful clusters using K-Means clustering?
What is the most appropriate number of clusters for representing the underlying structure of the data?
What are the key characteristics and distinguishing features of each identified cluster in terms of the included variables?
